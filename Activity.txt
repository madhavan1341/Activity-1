HTTP/1.1:

Older Protocol: Standardized in 1999.
No Multiplexing: Each resource request requires a separate connection, leading to slower loading times.
No Header Compression: Headers sent in plain text, resulting in extra overhead.
No Server Push: The server can't proactively send resources; it waits for client requests.
HTTP/2:

Modern Protocol: Standardized in 2015.
Multiplexing: Multiple requests and responses on a single connection, reducing latency.
Header Compression: Efficient compression minimizes data overhead.
Server Push: Servers can proactively send resources, improving page loading.
In a nutshell, HTTP/2 offers faster, more efficient web experiences, making it the preferred choice for modern websites and applications. Consider the switch for improved performance and user satisfaction.

Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript

JavaScript's objects are versatile data structures, holding key-value pairs and even functions. They're internally managed using property descriptors and a prototype chain. Optimizations like hidden classes make property access efficient. Understanding this internal representation helps write efficient, powerful code.
